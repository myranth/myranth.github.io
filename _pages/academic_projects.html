    A brief look at some of the work I did during my four years of University. As these were mostly for assignments, I will not provide code publicly.

<p>Other projects include a Lua parser written in Python, a Lego Mindstorms robot programmed with LeJOS to navigate a grid with paths blocked by obstacles,
    an investigation into predicting the outcomes of DotA 2 matches, and a client-server software suite to detect fraudulent data in a (made-up) stream of stock market
    transactions, as part of a group software project in my 2nd year.
