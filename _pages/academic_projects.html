<p>
    A brief look at some of the work I did during my four years of University. As these were mostly for assignments, I will not provide code publicly.

                    <span class="projectTagline">Python, Z3</span>
                    <p>
                        Rush Hour is a sliding puzzle game on a 6x6 board, consisting of different sized 'cars' that can slide vertically and horizontally.
                        The goal is to get one specific car to the exit square. The assignment was to encode the game as a propositional formula,
                        which would then be solved by the Z3 Theorem Prover, resulting in a solution to the puzzle provided.

<p>Other projects include a Lua parser written in Python, a Lego Mindstorms robot programmed with LeJOS to navigate a grid with paths blocked by obstacles,
    an investigation into predicting the outcomes of DotA 2 matches, and a client-server software suite to detect fraudulent data in a (made-up) stream of stock market
    transactions, as part of a group software project in my 2nd year.
