<p>This page lists notable software projects that I have worked on by myself or with others. Some of them were done as part of my University course, but I am listing them here
    as I was given a completely free choice over what I could do.

            Technically this website is also an ongoing project! It is built using 
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted for free on
            <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> (which is designed to work with Jekyll, how convenient). 
            You can view the source code of this website on Github <a href="https://github.com/myranth/myranth.github.io">here</a>.
