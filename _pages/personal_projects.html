<p>This page lists notable software projects that I have worked on by myself or with others. Some of them were done as part of my University course, but I am listing them here
    as I was given a completely free choice over what I could do.

                    <p>
                        Cavey Jones is my first attempt at coding a game from scratch. It is a coin-collecting platformer
                        with tricky jumps and things designed to kill you, inspired by some older platformers along with more recent,
                        difficult ones.

                    <p>
                        Lands of Terin is a program that procedurally generates and renders 3D landscapes in real time. The worlds are made up of different biomes which form
                        different land shapes and spawn different plants/trees. Other features include varying LOD (Level of Detail) terrain, reflective water, particles, and shadow mapping.

                    <p>
                        Cluster Chord is the name of my fourth year group project, which was an investigation into the generation of music (in MIDI format) via the use
                        of deep, recurrent neural networks. I was responsible for a lot of backend code, including transforming MIDI files into data suitable for a neural network (and back),
                        and training networks with various layouts/parameters.
