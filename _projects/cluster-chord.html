        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Cluster Chord was a 5-person project that investigated whether neural networks (which are being used for, 
            well, basically everything these days) were able to generate music in MIDI format. In particular we looked
            at RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) that used so-called GRU and LSTM cells. We were able to produce simple music
            that stayed within a key signature and sounded like it could have been composed by a human, but was limited to playing
            one note at a time.

        <h4>Sample music</h4>
        <p>
            You can download a small collection of MIDI files <a href="/assets/downloads/sampleMIDIs.zip">here</a>.

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <p>
            Neural networks are often used as classifiers i.e. they are trained to try and predict whether a piece of data belongs
            to one of various classes. For this task, we had 88 classes corresponding to the 88 notes on a grand piano. Each
            piece of training data consisted of 8 bars of music split into sixteenth notes; the class or label was the note being played
            the very next sixteenth along.
        </p>
        <p>
            By taking a database of MIDI files and splitting them into as many labelled 8 bar sections as possible, we had about 420,000 individual
            training samples. This allowed us to create a network that could 'guess' the next note. Adding this predicted note and then
            'sliding' the 8-bar window along to include it means you can then predict the note after that, and so on. In other words,
            the network can indefinitely generate new notes, eventually based off of music it has already written itself.
