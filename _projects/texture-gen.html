        <p>
            Following on from <a href="/projects/terin">generating 3D worlds</a>, I decided to have a look at generating
            textures in a small project sponsored by my University's <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/skills/urss/">URSS
            </a> (Undergraduate Research Support Scheme).</p>

            Originally I had planned on continuing to use Perlin noise for generation, but my supervisor showed me
            a method of creating images by applying filters in the frequency domain to a noisy image. I wrote some
            software that does this, while allowing the user to control the filter's general shape. I made a video
            demonstrating the software and explaining how the generation process works (hopefully without too much technical detail):
