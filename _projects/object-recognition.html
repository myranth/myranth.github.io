        <p>
            This was an assignment for an image and video analysis module. The task was to create a program that would
            read a video, and then play it back while highlighting which objects were visible (from a set of known objects).
            You can see the program working in the video below.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recognising objects is actually quite straightforward! It can be done by extracting SURF keypoints at each frame in the video
            and then finding the closest matches to the SURF keypoints on the objects. A SURF keypoint is a 'feature' or 'point
            of interest' in an image (often things like corners/edges) that is defined by a descriptor, which describes the
            keypoint's orientation and some information about pixels nearby. If the majority of an object's descriptors match
            the descriptors of the current video frame, it means the object is probably visible.
        </p>

        <p>
            The SURF algorithm is patented, but if you want you can read about how it works in the 
            <a href="http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~surf/eccv06.pdf">original paper</a>. It is invariant to rotation and scale; the video
            below shows that objects can be recognised regardless of their angle or how close to the camera they are.
