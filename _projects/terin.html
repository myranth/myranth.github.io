        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Lands of Terin is a piece of software I wrote for my third year project (over 9 months). It renders 3D landscapes that are procedurally
            generated in real time as the player moves around.
        </p>
        <p>The software was written with OpenGL 3.3 and C++, including a variety of libraries:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW</a> to load OpenGL</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL 2</a> for creating a window and managing keyboard events</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.lonesock.net/soil.html">SOIL</a> for loading images</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.assimp.org/">Assimp</a> for loading 3D models</li>
                <li><a href="http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/">Libnoise</a> for noise functions used to generate terrain</li>
                <li><a href="https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html">GLM</a> for maths relating to vectors and matrices</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The landscapes consist of 5 biomes, which each produce different terrain shapes (in terms of smoothness and height)
            and spawn different types of foliage. Some biomes will have small lakes or ponds, with realistic water
            that reflects and distorts its surroundings. The worlds are surrounded by a rotating sky-sphere to emulate clouds,
            and also contain a sun and a moon that create a day-night cycle with matching shadows.
