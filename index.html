    Hi there! My name is Phil Taylor. I graduated from The University of Warwick with an MEng in Computer Science in 2017.
    This website is primarily a portfolio to display what work I have done both academically and in my own time.
</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
    I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.moju.io">Moju</a>, doing a mixture of front-end
    and back-end work using Python/Flask, React and various AWS tools. Most of the time I use Arch Linux
    and Visual Studio Code for development.
</p>
<p>I have always been interested in both playing and making games. When I was younger I designed levels for
    a few Flash games, then made some simple tower defence/platformer games in Game Maker. I have recently been
    learning more professional level technologies (C++, OpenGL, Unreal Engine, a bit of Rust as well) and am currently
    looking to become a programmer in the games industry. These days I mostly play DotA 2 and Overwatch,
    but have spent many hours of my life on Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, Runescape and Guitar Hero.
</p>
<p>
    When not at a computer, I play guitar and drums. I like a good bit of power/prog rock/metal, including bands such as
    Dream Theater, Haken, An Endless Sporadic, Demetori. I also partake in Aikido whenever possible.
</p>

<h4>What is a Myranth?</h4>
<p>
The name Myranth has no meaning in particular, it is just a username/handle I commonly use. It was actually the name
of my first Dungeons and Dragons character! I play that weekly-ish (or at least, a variant on it called Fudge).
