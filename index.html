<p>Hi there! My name is Phil Taylor. I graduated from The University of Warwick with an MEng in Computer Science in 2017.
    I am currently working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.moju.io">Moju</a>.</p>
<p>This website is primarily a portfolio to display what work I have done both academically and in my own time. My main 
    interests lie in 3D graphics, game design and audio.</p>
